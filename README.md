AI Data Annotation Workflow

Objective
This project demonstrates a structured workflow for image and video annotation
used in training AI models. The focus is on instruction-based labeling, accuracy,
and quality control rather than model training.

Tasks Covered
- Image tagging based on textual descriptions
- Video frame-level annotation using instructions
- Structured labeling using CSV files
- Basic quality checks for missing or inconsistent labels

Annotation Principles
- Follow task instructions strictly
- Label only clearly visible objects or actions
- Mark ambiguous cases clearly
- Maintain consistency across annotations

Tools Used
- Python (basic data validation)
- CSV files for structured annotations
- GitHub for version control
- Google Sheets (annotation management)

Outcome
Simulates real-world AI dataset curation tasks involving accuracy reviews,
guideline compliance, and structured annotation pipelines.
